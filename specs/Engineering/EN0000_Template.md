## Goals of this Engineering Note
*What is this engineering note trying to accomplish?  Are we defining product requirements?  Are we planning the architectural requirements to meet some product requirement of feature?  Are we capturing important decisions as part of the design process?  Are we explaining a complex design?*

*Goals should be clear and concise. If goals are related to architectural or product requirements, reference the epic(s) and feature(s) to which this note applies.*

## Non-goals of this engineering note
*If there are non-goals, list them here.  Non-goals carefully discard confusing or unrelated topics from a note.  Non-goals are also useful for setting the scope of an engineering note, making it easier for the reader to understand whether a topic should or should not be addressed by the note.*

## Problem Summary
*Now that the goals are laid out, summarize the set of problems that are solved by this note.*

## Solution Space
*Briefly summarize the options/solutions available to solve the problem to meet the goals list in the first paragraph.  Note why certain solutions are out of scope, donâ€™t make sense, or were discarded.*

## Proposed Solution
*Describe the solution chosen to solve this problem.  Depending on the problem, the solution may encompass product requirements, a proposed architecture, or a design.*
