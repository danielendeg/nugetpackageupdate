# Background
In cryptography, format-preserving encryption (FPE), refers to encrypting in such a way that the output (the ciphertext) is in the same format as the input (the plaintext). The meaning of "format" varies. Typically only finite domains are discussed, for example:

* To encrypt a 16-digit credit card number so that the ciphertext is another 16-digit number.
* To encrypt an English word so that the ciphertext is another English word.
* To encrypt an n-bit number so that the ciphertext is another n-bit number (this is the definition of an n-bit block cipher).

# Prefix Cipher with CBC mode
## Prefix Cipher
The prefix cipher method uses AES or 3DES algorithm. For example encrypting 16 digit credit
card number applying an AES algorithm to each digit and store the digit and encrypting values in the table. The
table is sorted according to the encrypted value and the corresponding original digits are used as a cipher text.

Thus, to create a FPE on the domain {0,1,2,3}, given a key K apply AES(K) to each integer, giving, for example,
```
weight(0) = 0x56c644080098fc5570f2b329323dbf62
weight(1) = 0x08ee98c0d05e3dad3eb3d6236f23e7b7
weight(2) = 0x47d2e1bf72264fa01fb274465e56ba20
weight(3) = 0x077de40941c93774857961a8a772650d
```

Sorting [0,1,2,3] by weight gives [3,1,2,0], so the cipher is
```
F(0) = 3
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 2
F(3) = 0
```
The technique is useful only for small range of plain text as a large lookup table is not effective. But it is good for our scenario as 64 is a very small number.

**Security** Under the assumption that our underlying block cipher **E** (Here we use AES) is ideal, **I**
is equally likely to be any of the permutations on **M** (input/output space). The method remains good when E is secure in the sense of a PRP. \ 

**Efficiency** Enciphering and deciphering are constant-time
operations. The cost here is O(k) time and space used in the initialization step.
This clearly means that this method is practical only for small values of k. A
further practical consideration is that, although this initialization is a one-time
cost, it results in a table of sensitive data which must be stored somewhere.

**Concern** Since we are transforming Id characters based on a fixed table, same characters will be transfromed to another same character. For example, with a table generated by AES like
```
"a" => "W",
"b" => "9",
"c" => "e",
"d" => "P",
"e" => "1"
...
```
Provided plain text "abcda" , we can get cipher text "W9epW". The text patterns will still exist in cipher text.
A possible problem is prefix cipher might be attacked with statistic approaches 
When the resource Ids are composed with human names or ssn identifiers which has certain patterns.
Hence we propose to enhance Prefix Cipher with **CBC mode** to remove pattern from cipher texts.

## CBC Mode
In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point. To make each message unique, an initialization vector must be used in the first block.

In our case, the cipher is the prefix cipher, each chunk of plain text represents a character in Id, and Ciphertext is the encrypted character.
