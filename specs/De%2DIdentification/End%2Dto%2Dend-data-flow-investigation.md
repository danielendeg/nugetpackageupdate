This document mainly discusses inserting anonymized FHIR resources generated by FHIR-Tool-for-Anonymization into FHIR Server.

# Problem context
## FHIR resource anonymization
Currently, FHIR-Tool-for-Anonymization supports 3 anonymization methods: _redact_, _dateShift_ and _keep_.

- _redact_: can be further divided into _complete redact_ and _partial redact_. _complete redact_ removes the fields directly. _partial redact_ tries to keep as much information as possible, like initial digits of zip codes, ages not over 89, etc.
- _dateShift_: shifting the value within a 100-day differential.
- _keep_: retain the value as it is.

For _completely redacted_ fields, values are empty or null.
These data may cause the incompatibility between FHIR-Tool-for-Anonymization and FHIR Server.

## FHIR Server resource validation
Based on our current understanding, when creating resources in FHIR Server, there is a validation preprocess that checks whether the input resource meets some requirements.
If not, exceptions will be thrown and creation will be rejected.

**1. The resource _id_ follows a certain format.**
Anonymizing will not bring in extra violation to this rule, as _id_ is not modified by default anonymization configuration. [ @<7C029C39-BC06-6716-9569-44023A0AA6DA> we plan to support resource id replacement soon. Resource Ids are PIIs and should be replaced in our default config. It will be important to understand what format limitations are imposed on the ID field] [ @<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> Yes. Ids follow a regular expression: [A-Za-z0-9\-\.]{1,64}. In FHIR [spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#id): Any combination of upper- or lower-case ASCII letters ('A'..'Z', and 'a'..'z', numerals ('0'..'9'), '-' and '.', with a length limit of 64 characters. (This might be an integer, an un-prefixed OID, UUID or any other identifier pattern that meets these constraints.) We'll follow this rule when replacing Ids.]

**2. The xhtml in _Narrative.div_ is valid if it's not null or empty.**
Anonymizing will not bring in extra violation to this rule, as anonymized _Narrative.div_ is null.

**3. The resource is correctly provided, including required fields.**
Anonymizing may violate this rule.
For example, _Endpoint.address_ is a required field, but it may contain personal email addresses.
After anonymization, _Endpoint.address_ is completely redacted to empty or null.
It is rejected with _ResourceNotValidException_ by FHIR Server.

## Required fields
Required fields refer to those marked _min cardinality > 0_ in FHIR resource definitions.
But these fields may contain identifiers defined by HIPAA Safe Harbor method.
Among all FHIR resources, we have find out 26 required fields that may be completely redacted to empty or null by default configuration.

|Data|Type|Count|Fields|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Attachment|complex|1|Media.content|
|string (url/markdown)|primitive|2|Endpoint.address, SearchParameter.description|
|date/dateTime/instant|primitive|22|CapabilityStatement.date, MessageDefinition.date, NamingSystem.date, TerminologyCapabilities.date, Provenance.recorded, AuditEvent.recorded, Composition.date, Slot.start, Slot.end, CoverageEligibilityRequest.created, CoverageEligibilityResponse.created, Claim.created, ClaimResponse.created, PaymentNotice.created, PaymentReconciliation.created, PaymentReconciliation.paymentDate, ExplanationOfBenefit.created, MedicationAdministration.effective, ImmunizationRecommendation.date, NutritionOrder.dateTime, VisionPrescription.created, VisionPrescription.dateWritten|
|choice of types|both|1|Immunization.occurence (dateTime/string)|

Following are several validation result examples:

|Media.content (Attachment)|Result|
|:-:|:-:|
|**"content": \{"contentType": "image/gif", "data": ""\}**|**OK**|
|**"content": \{"url": "\*\*\*\*\*\*"\}**|**OK**|
|"content": \{"data": ""\}|OK|
|"content": \{\}|Invalid|
|"content": ""|Invalid|
|null (now)|Invalid|

|Endpoint.address (string)|Result|
|:-:|:-:|
|"address": "mailto:MARTIN.SMIETANKA@directnppes.com"|OK|
|**"address": "\*\*\*\*\*\*"**|**OK**|
|"address": 1.01|OK|
|"address": true|OK|
|"address": ""|Invalid|
|null (now)|Invalid|

|Slot.start (date\dateTime\instant)|Result|
|:-:|:-:|
|"start": "1913-12-25T09:15:00Z"|OK|
|**"start": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z" (default dateTime)**|**OK**|
|"start": "0000-00-00T00:00:00Z"|Invalid|
|"start": "******"|Invalid|
|"start": ""|Invalid|
|null (now)|Invalid|

Currently, required fields are not checked recursively in FHIR Server, which means only the children of root resource are checked.

## Conflict between anonymization and validation
Anonymization aims to ensure that identifiers defined by HIPAA Safe Harbor method are correctly anonymized.

Validation aims to ensure that resources are correctly provided according to FHIR resource definitions.

These two requirements may not be satisfied at the same time.
The conflict is that **required fields can contain identifiers**.
If these fields are kept, it does not meet the requirement of HIPAA Safe Harbor method.
If these fields are anonymized, it does not meet the requirement of FHIR resource definitions.

# Possible solutions
## 1. Set another validation preprocess for anonymized resources in FHIR Server.
We can **set another validation preprocess** for anonymized resources in FHIR Server, which loosens the constraint of fields that may contain identifiers.
We also need to **add a security label for the anonymized resources** in FHIR-Tool-for-Anonymization to distinguish them from other regular resources.
This solution needs further discussion with FHIR Server team.

Example of security labels in anonymized resources:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Endpoint",
  "id": "direct-endpoint",
  "meta" : {
    "security": [{
      "system": "https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ObservationValue/cs.html#v3-ObservationValue",
      "code": "REDACTED",
      "display": "Fields contain identifiers defined by HIPAA Safe Harbor method are redacted."
  }]},
  ...
}
```

The security labels can be accessed from FHIR Server with:
```
List<Coding> securityLabels = resource?.Meta?.Security;
```

- More information about security labels could be found in [spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security-labels.html) and user story #72972.

## 2. Figure out some way to make fields not completely empty or null in FHIR-Tool-for-Anonymization.
This solution requires no change in FHIR Server.
- **For date/dateTime/instant data**, we can change the value of complete redaction from empty or null to _0001-01-01_ (the default value of dateTime in C#). We may need to **double check** whether this behavior follows [HIPAA Safe Harbor method](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#safeharborguidance).
Besides, we recommend users to set partial redaction _enabled_ to minimize the number of complete redactions.
- **For string data**, we can support and recommend users to use _characterMask_.
With _characterMask_, values will be strings made up of masking characters instead of empty or null.
- **For [Attachment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Attachment) data**, different from above two primitive types, Attachment is a complex type that made up of several children fields.
They are implemented in 2 ways: a) setting _Attachment.data_ with _Attachment.contentType_; b) setting _Attachment.url_.
In both ways, we need to make sure not all fields are empty or null.
We can support and set up 3 _extended typeRules_ instead of anonymizing the whole Attachment in original configuration: "_Attachment.data: redact_", "_Attachment.contentType: keep_" "_Attachment.url: characterMask_".
So there will always be some value in Attachment's children fields.

## 3. Add a command-line option _validate_ to validate resources.
This solution does not solve the incompatibility, but it tells users what makes the resource incompatible with FHIR Server.

|Option|Name|Optionality|Default|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|validateInput|validateInput|Optional|false|Validate input resource files in verbose log|
|validateOutput|validateOutput|Optional|false|Validate output anonymized resource files in verbose log|

With above parameter set to true, users will get a detailed report in verbose log if the resource is non-conformant. [ @<7C029C39-BC06-6716-9569-44023A0AA6DA> does that mean the user must use verbose option in addition to validate option in order to see the validation results?] [ @<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> Yes, the validation options will only work in verbose mode (-v).] [ @<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> Update: Currently, _validateInput_ and _validateOutput_ options no longer depend on verbose option. With validation enabled, message about the invalid resource is always printed. Details why the resource is invalid are only given with verbose enabled.]

Example output if _validateOutput_:
```
ErrorMessage: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceNotValidException: The output is non-conformant with FHIR specification. Please open verbose log for more details. (-v)
```

Example output if _validateOutput_ and _verbose_:
```
dbug: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceValidator[0]
      The output of resource ID *** is non-conformant with FHIR specification: Element with min. cardinality 1 cannot be null for AddressElement in Endpoint.
dbug: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceValidator[0]
      The output of resource ID *** is non-conformant with FHIR specification: *** is not a correctly formatted Id for Value in Endpoint.
...
...
ErrorMessage: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceNotValidException: The output is non-conformant with FHIR specification. Please open verbose log for more details. (-v)
```

We call validation **both before and after** anonymization. [ @<7C029C39-BC06-6716-9569-44023A0AA6DA> if we always validate both input and output, this can be expensive and annoying to the user. Imagine a scenario in which the user is trying to iteratively create a configuration file using the same input file which is valid. There is no point in validating input every time if it is not changing. validating input and output should be indepenent][ @<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> Agreed! Thanks for pointing this out. The option is separated into _validateInput_ and _validateOutput_ in above table.] The first call checks the input resource. The second call checks the anonymized output resource.

Example input resource:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Slot",
  "id": "3",
  "text": {
    "status": "generated",
    "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\t\t\t25 Dec 2013 9:30am - 9:45am: <b>Unavailable</b> Physiotherapy<br/>\n\t\t\tDr Careful is out of the office\n\t\t</div>"
  },
  "serviceCategory": [
    {
      "coding": [
        {
          "code": "17",
          "display": "General Practice"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "schedule": {
    "reference": "Schedule/example"
  },
  "status": "busy-unavailable",
  "end": "1913-12-25T09:45:00Z",
  "comment": "Dr Careful is out of the office"
}
```

Validation result for input resource:
```
dbug: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceValidator[0]
      The input of resource ID 3 is non-conformant with FHIR specification: Element with min. cardinality 1 cannot be null for StartElement in Slot.
```

Anonymized output resource:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Slot",
  "id": "3",
  "serviceCategory": [
    {
      "coding": [
        {
          "code": "17",
          "display": "General Practice"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "schedule": {
    "reference": "Schedule/example"
  },
  "status": "busy-unavailable"
}
```
Validation result for output resource:
```
dbug: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceValidator[0]
      The output of resource ID 3 is non-conformant with FHIR specification: Element with min. cardinality 1 cannot be null for StartElement in Slot.
dbug: Fhir.Anonymizer.Core.Validation.ResourceValidator[0]
      The output of resource ID 3 is non-conformant with FHIR specification: Element with min. cardinality 1 cannot be null for EndElement in Slot.
```

### Implementation

Firstly, we investigated _Hl7.Fhir.Specification.Validator_ used in [Profiles and Validation](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_wiki/wikis/Resolute.wiki/30/Profiles-and-Validation).

It performs a more strict validation than FHIR Server. For example, resources are checked recursively with it, but are not checked recursively in FHIR Server. [ @<7C029C39-BC06-6716-9569-44023A0AA6DA> this may not be true. I have started a mail thread with Michael. Please follow up with him.] [ @<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> Got it. Thanks!] [ @<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> Update from the mail thread discussion: According to the discussion, our FHIR Server conducts a light-weight validation instead of the complete validation against the specification. Since different FHIR Servers may have different implementations of validation, and our target is to help users insert anonymized data into our FHIR Server, I think we can follow exact the same validation as our FHIR Server does.][ @<7C029C39-BC06-6716-9569-44023A0AA6DA>,@<356939D1-F4CA-6BA1-875C-7247D42D7353> With customized validation, how are we going to keep it in sync with that in FHIR server? Can we use some published profile for default validation? ][Yes, it makes sense to use profile for validation. @<7C029C39-BC06-6716-9569-44023A0AA6DA> 
 please investigate][Update: By discussion in email, there are multiple levels of validation provided by Hl7.Fhir library, e.g., basic, profile, etc. Validation against profile requires more processing. Currently, we provide a basic level validation.]

Example resource:
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "pat1",
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Donald",
      "given": [
        "Duck"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "link": [
    {
      "other": {
        "reference": "Patient/pat2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Validation result of _Hl7.Fhir.Specification.Validator_:
```
"Instance count for 'Patient.link.type' is 0, which is not within the specified cardinality of 1..1"
```

Validation result of FHIR Server:
```json
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "information",
            "code": "informational",
            "diagnostics": "All OK"
        }
    ]
}
```

To be exactly the same with FHIR Server, we need to reuse the 3 validators used in FHIR Server and their dependency: [_IdValidator_](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core/Features/Validation/FhirPrimitiveTypes/IdValidator.cs), [_AttributeValidator_](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core/Features/Validation/AttributeValidator.cs), [_NarrativeValidator_](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core/Features/Validation/NarrativeValidator.cs). The logic of _NarrativeValidator_ and its dependency [_NarrativeHtmlSanitizer_](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core/Features/Validation/Narratives/NarrativeHtmlSanitizer.cs) is relatively complex (300-400 lines in total), while the logic of _IdValidator_ and _AttributeValidator_ is relatively simple (regular expression and function call of _Hl7.Fhir.Validation.DotNetAttributeValidation_, respectively).
