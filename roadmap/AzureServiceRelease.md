# Azure API for FHIR Service release requirements

The purpose of this document is to scope out all the necessary work needed to release Azure API for FHIR as an Azure Service. This includes:

- Billing Services and creating our billing meters
- Any outstanding work with CSS to support the service at GA time
- Localization work needed to be done in order to comply with Azure standards
- Compliance work needed for Release Tracker (Security Reviews, Privacy,…)
- Documentation
- Any other engineering work that needs to be done (ARM work, infrastructure optimization, Performance/Scaling,…)
- Geo expansion and deployment plan
- BCDR, GDPR and Privacy work
